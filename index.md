A Network Penetration Testing Toolkit is an interactive cheat sheet, containing a curated list of tools, commands, and payloads specifically for network security assessments and penetration testing engagements.

If you often find yourself searching for the right command to use against network devices, servers, or infrastructure, this project aims to simplify your workflow. Just select the information you have about the target environment (such as credentials, services, or open ports), and NVAToolkit will display relevant tools and template commands for quick reference and easy copy/pasting. See the full list of [items](/items/) and [filters](/filters/).

This project was created by [Gnanaraj Mauviel aka 0xm3m](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gnanaraj-mauviel/) and was inspired by [GTFOBins][GTFOBins], and [LOLBAS][LOLBAS]. The [WADComs'][WADComs] site template was heavily used in building this toolkit.

NVAToolkit is intended as a [collaborative project][collaborative], so contributions of new commands and tools are welcome. Please feel free to [contribute][contribute]!
