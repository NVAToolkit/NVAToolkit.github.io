  The "RunAs" function in PowerShell is used to run a specific command or script as a different user. This can be particularly useful when you need to execute commands or scripts with elevated privileges or within a different security context. When dealing with multiple domains, especially in an Active Directory environment, executing commands in a different domain requires careful consideration due to security boundaries. Which can be usefull to execute commands as a domain user on a non domain PC.

  Command Reference:
  ```
  Username: mmaas

  Domain: domain.local

  Command: powershell_ise.exe

  /netonly allows you to open a new process with alternative credentials
  ```
